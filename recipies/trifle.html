      <h3>Description</h3>
     
    
      <p>Trifle is a British dessert known for its beautiful layers and sweet surprise in every spoonful. Traditionally made with sponge cake, custard, fruit, jelly, and whipped cream, it’s both eye-catching and delicious. Just be sure not to follow Rachel Green’s accidental recipe—because no one wants beef sautéed with peas and onions in their dessert (except maybe Joey).</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare cake layer: Cut sponge cake or pound cake into cubes.</li>
    <li>Layer jelly: Add fruit-flavored jelly over cake cubes in a large glass bowl. Chill until set.</li>
    <li>Add fruits: Layer with chopped fruits like strawberries, bananas, or mangoes.</li>
    <li>Add custard: Pour a thick layer of vanilla custard over the fruit.</li>
    <li>Top with whipped cream: Spread a generous amount of whipped cream on top.</li>
    <li>Decorate: Garnish with more fruit or sprinkles. Chill and serve cold</li>
   </ol>
