      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Trifle is a British dessert known for its beautiful layers and sweet surprise in every spoonful. Traditionally made with sponge cake, custard, fruit, jelly, and whipped cream, it’s both eye-catching and delicious. Just be sure not to follow Rachel Green’s accidental recipe—because no one wants beef sautéed with peas and onions in their dessert (except maybe Joey).</p>
