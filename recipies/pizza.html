      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Pizza is the ultimate crowd-pleaser, and no one loved it more than Joey Tribbiani. This iconic dish starts with a crisp yet chewy dough base, topped with tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and endless topping possibilities—from classic pepperoni to fresh veggies. Whether you're grabbing a New York-style slice or sharing a homemade pie, pizza always brings a slice of happiness.</p>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Make the dough (or use store-bought): Mix flour, yeast, water, and salt to form dough. Let it rise for 1–2 hours.</li>
    <li>Prepare toppings: Slice fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. Tear some fresh basil leaves.

</li>
    <li>Roll the dough: Flatten the dough into a circle on a floured surface.</li>
    <li>Add sauce and toppings: Spread tomato sauce, add mozzarella slices, and tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Bake: Place in a preheated oven (220°C or 425°F) for 12–15 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese bubbles.</li>
    <li>Garnish and serve: Add basil leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Slice and enjoy!</li>
