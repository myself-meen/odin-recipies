   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>A hearty Italian classic, lasagna is a layered pasta dish packed with flavor and comfort. It features sheets of pasta alternated with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and gooey mozzarella, all baked to golden perfection. Whether you're making Monica’s infamous meat lasagna or going vegetarian, each bite is a satisfying blend of textures and flavors that’s perfect for family dinners or comfort food cravings.</p>
   <h3>Steps</h3>

    <li>Cook the meat: In a pan, sauté onions and garlic, then add ground beef. Cook until browned. Add tomato sauce and simmer.</li>
    <li>Prepare the cheese mix: Combine ricotta (or cottage cheese), an egg, and some grated Parmesan in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Boil the pasta: Cook lasagna noodles until al dente, then drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Layer it up: In a baking dish, spread a little meat sauce, then layer noodles, cheese mix, meat sauce, and shredded mozzarella. Repeat layers.</li>
    <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until golden.</li>
